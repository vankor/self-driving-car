# CarND-Controls-MPC


## Model description
This project is aimed to create MPC-Control to make a car follow reference trajectory as close as possible. Simulation is running inside of Udacity simulator.

MPC Model includes following parameters:
- x and y car coordinates
- velocity
- car orientation angle

Following error types are applicable to the model:
- cross track error (cte)
- orientation error (psi error)

Model calculates current step parameters based on previous step parameters for given steps count and time step size.

## N and dt values
Choosen values are N = 9 and dt = 0.1. Such values provide quite good performance and latency. Many combinations were being tried like: 15/0.05; 12/0.07; 20/0.02; 10/0.2; 9/0.15 etc.

Dt value reflects how frequent optimizer will set a corrective trajectory. So, smaller Dt values can provide better accuracy because trajectory corrections will be performed more frequently.

N value means how many steps to the future prediction model will see to find optimal actuators values. Larger N values need more computational time, so it is not always reasonable to have large N.

In general larger time horizon N*dt can give better driving accurcy on high speed because there is more information required to make effective driving actions on hight speed.

## Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
Waypoint coordinates were transformed to vehicle coodinate system (origin position is a vehicle position at (0, 0)).
Polyfit and polyeval functions were being used to find coefficients from given waypoints. See transformWayPoints function in main.cpp.

## Model Predictive Control with Latency
Latency problem was solved using actuator values from more previous steps (current step - 2). Also for hard turns there was penaltized high velocity. So velocity * steering_angle value penaltizes cost function to have safer car behaviour on turns (break on turns).
